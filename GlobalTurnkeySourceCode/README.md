# Global-Turnkey-.NET-SDK
This  library provides integration access to the Turnkey Global Api.

## Quick Start

Payments .NET SDK is a small library of C# code that you can use to quickly integrate with the Payments system and submit transactions, check their status and more.

## Before you Begin

Before using the Payments .NET SDK you should be familiar with the contents of the [API Specification for Merchants](docs/API-Specification.pdf) document as it describes all fields and their meaning within a given payment transaction.

## Setup your Project

Payments .NET SDK is delivered as .NET Class Library project.

It depends on a third party library: Newtonsoft.Json(version:12.0.0.0)

requirements: .NET Framework 4.5 (or newer)

## Form examples

You can find various examples from another project(GlobalTurnkey web application), in the GlobalTurnkey\Views\Home\index.cshtml file.

## Possible Requests

Every payment operation has its own Call Object. To successfully perform any request one needs to create the object (configure it) and then call its execute() method.

* __GetAvailablePaymentSolutionsCall__ queries the list of the possible payment solutions (ie. credit card) (based on the country/currency)
* __TokenizeCall__ tokenizes the card for future use.
* __AuthCall__ requests authorisation for a payment.
* __CaptureCall__ performs a capture operation on an authorized payment.
* __VerifyCall__ performs a verify operation on an authorized payment.
* __VoidCall__ cancels a previously authenticated payment.
* __PurchaseCall__ does an authorize and capture operations at once (and cannot be voided).
* __PurchaseTokenCall__ performs a tokeniza request operation to prepare a token for load payment request using.
* __RefundCall__ refunds a previous capture operation, partially or in full.
* __StatusCheckCall__ returns the status of an already issued payment transaction, as such it doesnâ€™t actually generate a new transaction.

All classes are descendants of the _ApiCall_ class.

For more information on payment transactions please check the [API Specification for Merchants](docs/API-Specification.pdf) document.

Some of the possible request/call chains (ie. tokenize -> auth -> capture) can be seen in the unit test to.

## Typical Flow

### I. Access the ApplicationConfig object like this:

ApplicationConfig config = new ApplicationConfig()
            {
                MerchantId = Properties.Settings.Default.merchantId,
                Password = Properties.Settings.Default.password,
                SessionTokenRequestUrl = Properties.Settings.Default.sessionTokenRequestUrl,
                PaymentOperationActionUrl = Properties.Settings.Default.paymentOperationActionUrl,
                AllowOriginUrl = Properties.Settings.Default.allowOriginUrl,
                MerchantNotificationUrl = Properties.Settings.Default.merchantNotificationUrl,
                MerchantLandingPageUrl = Properties.Settings.Default.merchantLandingPageUrl,
                CashierUrl = Properties.Settings.Default.cashierUrl,
            };

### II. Create the a Call object:


Dictionary<String, String> params = new Dictionary<String, String>();
inputParams.Add("country", "FR");
inputParams.Add("currency", "EUR");

ApiCall call = new GetAvailablePaymentSolutionsCall(config, params);


The call parameters have to supplied via a Dictionary. 
For more information on the possible/needed dictionary parameters please check the [API Specification for Merchants](docs/API-Specification.pdf) document.

The constructor will do a simple "pre" validation on the params Dictionary. It will only check for the required keys (without an HTTP/API call).

### III. Execute the call:

Dictionary<String, String> result = call.execute();

For more information on the possible result values (KeyValuePair) please check the [API Specification for Merchants](docs/API-Specification.pdf) document.

### IV. Watch for Exceptions

Occasionally the SDK will not be able to perform your request and it will throw an Exception. This could be due to some unexpected conditions like no connectivity to the API. 

Exceptions are described in more detail in a later section of this document.


try {
	ApiCall call = new GetAvailablePaymentSolutionsCall(config, params);
} catch (RequiredParamException e) {
	// notify the user, exit the program, redirect to the error page etc.
}



try {
	Dictionary<String, String> result = call.execute();
} catch (ActionCallException e) {
	// notify the user, exit the program, redirect to the error page etc.
}


## Payments Errors

Occasionally your payment processing API will not be able to successfully complete a request and it will return an error. Please check out the [API Specification for Merchants](docs/API-Specification.pdf) document to find out more about errors and what causes them to occur.

## Exceptions

In addition the .NET SDK provides custom exceptions:

* _PostToApiException_
	Error in (around) the outgoing (toward the API server) HTTP client call (most likely: failed HTTP request, failed response parsing, failed request body creation). 
* _RequiredParamException_
	Thrown when a mandatory parameter has not been set (this is just a simple "pre" validation, without the API server, thrown by the constructor).
* _TokenAcquirationException_
	Failed to aquire the token for the action call.
* _ActionCallException_
	Failure during the main (the action) call.  
* _GeneralException_
	Other, not specified error in the SDK code. You can use getCause() to inspect the underlying Exception.
    
All these classes inherit from Exception class so that you can easily separate them in a try-catch block.
